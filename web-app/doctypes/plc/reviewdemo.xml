            <para>Based on a human rights index which measured the UK's compliance with
                its international human rights obligations, this book aims to provide a framework
                for monitoring and evaluating the impact of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the
                Act) which came into force on 2nd October, 2000 (PLC, 2000, XI(9), 7). The
                Act incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention)
                into UK domestic law.
