        <title>Exclusivity agreements</title>
        <abstract>
            <para>Exclusivity agreements are used to try to ensure that the other party
                to a prospective deal negotiates solely with you for a period of time. They
                aim to give you some protection from another party outbidding you. This topic
                includes materials and specimen agreements. They are enforceable in many
                European countries, but they usually only achieve temporary protection. In
                many continental European jurisdictions you already have some protection even
                where there is no such agreements through a general duty to negotiate in good
                faith.
