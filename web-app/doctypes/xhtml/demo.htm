<div><h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>

    <p>In 1986, the Standard
        Generalized Markup Language (SGML) became an international standard for the
        format of text and documents. SGML has withstood the test of time. Its popularity
        is rapidly increasing among organizations with large amounts of document data
        to create, manage, and distribute. However, various barriers exist to delivering
        SGML over the Web. These barriers include the lack of widely supported stylesheets,
        complex software because of SGML's broad and powerful options, and obstacles
        to interchange of SGML data because of varying levels of SGML compliance among
        SGML software packages.</p>

    <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the pervasive
        data format for the World Wide Web. While HTML provides an outstanding mechanism
        to deliver simple documents over the Web, its simplicity imposes limitations
        that significantly raise the cost of deploying complex websites.</p>

    <p>Because
        of the lack of SGML support in mainstream Web browsers, most applications
        that deliver SGML information over the Web convert the SGML to HTML. This
        down-translation removes much of the intelligence of the original SGML information.
        That lost intelligence virtually eliminates information flexibility and poses
        a significant barrier to reuse, interchange, and automation.</p>

    <p>The Extensible
        Markup Language (XML) is being developed to enable delivery of SGML information
        over the Web while overcoming the limitations of HTML. The momentum building
        behind the XML effort means that XML is inevitably destined to become the
        mainstream technology for powering broadly functional and highly valuable
        business applications on the Internet, intranets, and extranets.</p>

    <p>This
        white paper separates the hype of XML from its reality in order to provide
        answers to business-critical questions such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Why doesn't HTML or SGML meet my needs for Web delivery?"</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>"How is XML easier than full SGML?"</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>"When should I choose XML instead of full SGML?"</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>"When I chose to use SGML, did I make a mistake?"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In response to these and similar questions, this paper shows why:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>XML will displace HTML in Web applications where high degrees of reuse,
            interchange, and automation are required.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>XML will displace HTML as the preferred way to deliver SGML information
            over the Web.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Full SGML will remain the preferred data format for creating and storing
            enterprise-critical documents and data, with XML used for delivery.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>In addition to powering document applications, XML will enable non-document
            applications over the Web.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>You should read this white paper if the following
        apply to you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You're involved with the systematic gathering, management, and delivery
            of information embodied in documents. You're responsible for technical publishing,
            knowledge management, document management, Web publishing, or intranet publishing.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>You're a manager or executive who wants to know the impact of XML on your
            planned or existing implementations of SGML-based systems. You're wondering
            about the business-related differences between XML and SGML.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>You're considering, planning, implementing, or operating an SGML-based
            system and you're wondering if you should use XML instead.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're unfamiliar with the terminology and concepts of Standard
        Generalized Markup Language (SGML), then you should become acquainted with
        SGML in order to gain the most benefit from reading this paper. One valuable
        source is Arbortext's white paper, <i>Getting Started With SGML</i>. This

<div><h2><a
        name="SGMLonTheWeb">XML: For SGML on the Web</a></h2>

    <p>XML, or Extensible
        Markup Language, is a highly functional subset of SGML. The purpose of XML
        is to specify an SGML subset that works very well for delivering SGML information
        over the Web. When the mainstream Web browsers support XML, we believe that
        it's going to be very easy to publish SGML information on the Web.</p>

    <p>XML
        is almost indistinguishable from SGML <i>as practiced</i>. XML has almost
        all of the capabilities of SGML that are widely supported. XML also lacks
        some important capabilities of SGML that primarily affect document creation,
        not document delivery. That's because XML was <i>not</i> designed to replace
        SGML in every respect. As you will see, SGML remains the appropriate technology
        for creating and storing information.</p>

<div><h2><a
        name="inventors">XML's Inventors</a></h2>

    <p>XML is being designed by a Working
        Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an organization whose charter
        is to establish specifications for Web technologies to ensure the highest
        possible degree of utility and interoperability.</p>

    <p>The XML Working Group
        consists of about 14 companies and organizations with a strong interest in
        either providing or utilizing XML tools. This group includes Adobe, Arbortext,
        DataChannel, Fuji Xerox, Hewlett-Packard, Inso, Isogen, Microsoft, Netscape,
        SoftQuad, Sun Microsystems, and the University of Chicago, along with Dan
        Connolly, a W3C representative, and James Clark, an independent expert. Most
        of the Working Group members bring considerable experience with SGML to the
        task of defining and refining XML.</p>
