                <para>The word "gift" is not used in the IHT legislation, although it is used in this note for ease.
                    The legislation actually uses defined terms such as "disposition", "transfer of value" and
                    "chargeable transfer", which cover a wide range of circumstances not always immediately
                    recognised as being "gifts". The purpose is to cover lifetime transactions that result in a loss
                    to the donor's estate (and an increase in the donee's estate), unless the transaction is for
                    genuine commercial reasons and there is no gratuitous intent.

                <para>The legislation does not only cover gifts of cash or specific assets. It also covers, for

                    of "excluded property" which fall outside the scope of the IHT legislation.

                    <para>On 3 March 2011, the Office of Tax Simplification (OTS) published a final report on its
                        tax reliefs review, which was commissioned by the Coalition government in November 2010. In
                        its report, the OTS recommended that IHT reliefs be reviewed in the context of a separate
                        review of IHT as a whole and that any review of IHT must include a review of the taxation of

                <para>"Domicile" is a complex concept which is based on a long line of cases in the field of
                    international law. It has been incorporated into the IHT legislation as a means of reducing
                    exposure to IHT for those who have only a temporary link with the UK.
                </para>
                <para>In this context, domicile has a specific legal meaning, beyond the simple dictionary
                    definition of "place of residence". An individual can be resident in the UK for many years and
                    yet be domiciled elsewhere. In certain (more unusual) circumstances, an individual can also be
                    domiciled in the UK without having set foot here. For further information on domicile, see

                    worldwide estate, even though they are not domiciled in the UK under the general law. The
                    rationale for this is that they have lived in the UK for a long time and should therefore
                    contribute more tax. The following individuals are "deemed domiciled" in the UK for IHT

                        death. This limit also applies when calculating the transferable nil rate band that can be
                        claimed by the personal representatives of a non-UK domiciled spouse who is predeceased by a
                        UK domiciled spouse.

                    </para>
                    <para>A useful way to remember this is to consider the rationale. When assets pass from a UK
                        domiciled spouse to a non-UK domiciled spouse, they are potentially leaving the IHT "net"
                        forever (because the non-UK domiciled spouse may not be subject to IHT on his or her death).
                        By limiting the spouse exemption in these circumstances, the lion's share of IHT is secured
                        on the first spouse's death.
                    </para>
                    <para>The government announced in its 2012 Budget on 21 March 2012 that it would publish a
                        consultation document, with draft legislation, on its plans to increase the amount that a UK
                        domiciled spouse or civil partner can give to his non-domiciled spouse or civil partner free
                        from IHT. The legislation will form part of Finance Bill 2013. The consultation will propose
                        an increase in the spouse exemption from £55,000 to £325,000 that will then track any future
                        increases in the nil rate band. There will also be an option for the non-domiciled spouse to
                        elect to be treated as deemed domiciled so that they can benefit from the unlimited spouse
                        exemption that gifts to UK-domiciled spouses and civil partners currently enjoy. It is now
                        known that the consultation will be published in May 2012.
                    </para>
                    <para>The government published draft legislation on 11 December 2012 to increase the amount that
                        a UK domiciled individual can transfer to his non-UK domiciled spouse or civil partner free
                        from IHT. The measure will raise the £55,000 limit to the level of the prevailing IHT nil
                        rate band. Non-UK domiciled individuals who have a UK domiciled spouse or civil partner will
                        be able to elect to be treated as UK domiciled for IHT purposes. The legislation will have
                        effect for transfers made on or after 6 April 2013.

                    <para>The GROB provisions were intended to prevent artificial avoidance of IHT by exploiting
                        loopholes in the legislation. They have not been totally successful, as many schemes
                        (usually involving houses or chattels) were created to get round the provisions (one example
                        is the

                        (POAC) was introduced with effect from 6 April 2005.
                    </para>
                    <para>Broadly, POAC applies where an individual gives away property (for example land and
                        buildings, chattels or money and investments) and subsequently benefits from that property
                        (or property derived from it). If caught, an annual income tax charge is imposed on the
                        donor in relation to the benefit he receives from the property, unless he elects for the
                        gift to be taxed as a GROB. The election must be made by the 31 January following the tax
                        year in which the individual first becomes liable to POAC. (
