It has been incorporated into the IHT legislation as a means of reducing\u000d\u000a                        exposure to IHT for those who have only a temporary link with the UK.\u000d\u000a                    </para>\u000d\u000a                    <para>In this context, domicile has a specific legal meaning, beyond the simple dictionary\u000d\u000a                        definition of "place of residence". An individual can be resident in the UK for many years and\u000d\u000a                        yet be domiciled elsewhere. In certain (more unusual) circumstances, an individual can also be\u000d\u000a                        domiciled in the UK without having set foot here.

A taxable person is an individual, limited company or other entity which is registered, or\u000d\u000a            required to be registered for VAT. The threshold for compulsory registration is a historical annual turnover\u000d\u000a            of \u00a350,000. However, a taxpayer may choose to register voluntarily.\u000d\u000a        </para>\u000d\u000a        <para>Input and output tax. VAT is borne economically by the ultimate consumer of the goods or services supplied\u000d\u000a            but is the liability of the person making the supply. Suppliers generally deduct an amount equal to the VAT\u000d\u000a            on the supplies to them (input tax) from the VAT which they charge on onward supplies (output tax) and pay\u000d\u000a            the difference to Customs. At each stage of the supply chain the net VAT paid is on the value added at that\u000d\u000a            stage.\u000d\u000a        </para>\u000d\u000a        <para>Categories. Supplies are divided into three main categories: standard rated supplies, zero rated supplies\u000d\u000a            and exempt supplies. Most supplies are standard rated and therefore subject to VAT at the standard rate of\u000d\u000a            17.5%. Zero rated supplies do not require the supplier to charge VAT. They comprise a number of socially\u000d\u000a            beneficial items such as new houses, however, unlike an exempt supply a zero rated supply is a taxable\u000d\u000a            supply chargeable at a zero rate. Suppliers are not required to account for output tax on exempt supplies\u000d\u000a            but are unable to recover the input tax on those supplies which they receive that are attributable to the\u000d\u000a            exempt supplies. Exempt supplies include financial services and certain property transactions.\u000d\u000a        </para>\u000d\u000a        <para>Supplies.

These include the transfer of a business as a going concern, services of\u000d\u000a            employees, most supplies between members of a VAT group, dividends and transactions between divisions of the\u000d\u000a            same corporate body.\u000d\u000a        </para>\u000d\u000a        <para>Group registration.

However, a tax payer can choose to register if\u000d\u000a                    he has a taxable turnover below \u00a350,000.

The supplier normally passes\u000d\u000a                    that liability on to his customer by identifying the price that he would have charged for his supply\u000d\u000a                    in the absence of VAT and increasing that price by an amount equal to the VAT that is in fact\u000d\u000a                    chargeable on the supply. A supplier''s liability to pay VAT is thus simply another expense that a\u000d\u000a                    supplier should take into account when charging for goods. The only difference from other expenses\u000d\u000a                    is that, by convention, the additional amount paid by the recipient of the supply in respect of VAT\u000d\u000a                    is separately delineated.\u000d\u000a                </para>\u000d\u000a                <para>VAT is therefore not a charge on the consumer as such, nor is the consumer "paying VAT"; he is\u000d\u000a                    paying additional consideration for the supply equal to the VAT liability of the supplier.

Thus, in economic\u000d\u000a                    terms, a zero rated supply breaks the accumulation of tax on added value which generally builds up\u000d\u000a                    in the supply chain.\u000d\u000a                </para>\u000d\u000a                <para>For example, suppose that A supplies machinery to B, a clothes supplier, for \u00a3100 plus \u00a317.50 in\u000d\u000a                    respect of VAT.

The effect of this is that, in setting its prices for\u000d\u000a                    C, B will take into account only \u00a3100 of machinery costs as B will have recovered an amount equal to\u000d\u000a                    the aggregate of the VAT accounted for by A.

A taxable person is an individual, limited company or other entity which is registered, or\u000d\u000a            required to be registered for VAT. The threshold for compulsory registration is a historical annual turnover\u000d\u000a            of \u00a350,000. However, a taxpayer may choose to register voluntarily.\u000d\u000a        </para>\u000d\u000a        <para>Input and output tax. VAT is borne economically by the ultimate consumer of the goods or services supplied\u000d\u000a            but is the liability of the person making the supply. Suppliers generally deduct an amount equal to the VAT\u000d\u000a            on the supplies to them (input tax) from the VAT which they charge on onward supplies (output tax) and pay\u000d\u000a            the difference to Customs. At each stage of the supply chain the net VAT paid is on the value added at that\u000d\u000a            stage.\u000d\u000a        </para>\u000d\u000a        <para>Categories. Supplies are divided into three main categories: standard rated supplies, zero rated supplies\u000d\u000a            and exempt supplies. Most supplies are standard rated and therefore subject to VAT at the standard rate of\u000d\u000a            17.5%. Zero rated supplies do not require the supplier to charge VAT. They comprise a number of socially\u000d\u000a            beneficial items such as new houses, however, unlike an exempt supply a zero rated supply is a taxable\u000d\u000a            supply chargeable at a zero rate. Suppliers are not required to account for output tax on exempt supplies\u000d\u000a            but are unable to recover the input tax on those supplies which they receive that are attributable to the\u000d\u000a            exempt supplies. Exempt supplies include financial services and certain property transactions.\u000d\u000a        </para>\u000d\u000a        <para>Supplies. VAT legislation does not exhaustively define the term supply but it is very broad in its scope.\u000d\u000a            The distinction as to whether a supply is one of goods or services is important as different rules apply to\u000d\u000a            the time and place of supply. Also the treatment of the international supply of goods and services is\u000d\u000a            different.\u000d\u000a        </para>\u000d\u000a        <para>VAT is charged at the value of a supply.

These include the transfer of a business as a going concern, services of\u000d\u000a            employees, most supplies between members of a VAT group, dividends and transactions between divisions of the\u000d\u000a            same corporate body.\u000d\u000a        </para>\u000d\u000a        <para>Group registration. Two or more companies can be registered as a group for VAT purposes if one controls\u000d\u000a            the others or some person controls all of them and each company either is resident in the UK for VAT\u000d\u000a            purposes or has an established place of business in the UK.

One\u000d\u000a            of the main advantages of group registration is that transactions between members of a group are ignored for\u000d\u000a            VAT purposes.\u000d\u000a        </para>\u000d\u000a    </speedread>\u000d\u000a    <fulltext>\u000d\u000a        <section1>\u000d\u000a            <para>\u000d\u000a                <graphic fileref="binaryContent.jsp?item=835914"/>\u000d\u000a            </para>\u000d\u000a            <para>Value added tax (VAT), alone among UK taxes, is an EU tax.

The primary UK legislation on\u000d\u000a                VAT is the Value Added Tax Act 1994 (VATA 1994). This provides the framework of the tax but much of the\u000d\u000a                detail is found in statutory instruments, either in the form of orders made by the Treasury or\u000d\u000a                regulations made by Customs &amp; Excise.

The threshold for compulsory\u000d\u000a                    registration is an historical annual turnover of \u00a350,000. A person must also register if he expects\u000d\u000a                    his turnover in the next 30 days to exceed \u00a350,000. However, a tax payer can choose to register if\u000d\u000a                    he has a taxable turnover below \u00a350,000.

The supplier normally passes\u000d\u000a                    that liability on to his customer by identifying the price that he would have charged for his supply\u000d\u000a                    in the absence of VAT and increasing that price by an amount equal to the VAT that is in fact\u000d\u000a                    chargeable on the supply. A supplier''s liability to pay VAT is thus simply another expense that a\u000d\u000a                    supplier should take into account when charging for goods.

A taxable person is an individual, limited company or other entity which is registered, or required to be registered for VAT. The threshold for compulsory registration is a historical annual turnover of \u00a350,000. However, a taxpayer may choose to register voluntarily. </para><para>Input and output tax. VAT is borne economically by the ultimate consumer of the goods or services supplied but is the liability of the person making the supply. Suppliers generally deduct an amount equal to the VAT on the supplies to them (input tax) from the VAT which they charge on onward supplies (output tax) and pay the difference to Customs. At each stage of the supply chain the net VAT paid is on the value added at that stage. </para><para>Categories. Supplies are divided into three main categories: standard rated supplies, zero rated supplies and exempt supplies. Most supplies are standard rated and therefore subject to VAT at the standard rate of 17.5%. Zero rated supplies do not require the supplier to charge VAT. They comprise a number of socially beneficial items such as new houses, however, unlike an exempt supply a zero rated supply is a taxable supply chargeable at a zero rate. Suppliers are not required to account for output tax on exempt supplies but are unable to recover the input tax on those supplies which they receive that are attributable to the exempt supplies. Exempt supplies include financial services and certain property transactions. </para><para>Supplies. VAT legislation does not exhaustively define the term supply but it is very broad in its scope. The distinction as to whether a supply is one of goods or services is important as different rules apply to the time and place of supply. Also the treatment of the international supply of goods and services is different. </para><para>VAT is charged at the value of a supply. The consideration agreed on is always inclusive of VAT unless the contrary is specified. </para><para>There are a number of transactions that are treated as neither a supply of goods nor of services and are therefore outside the scope of VAT. These include the transfer of a business as a going concern, services of employees, most supplies between members of a VAT group, dividends and transactions between divisions of the same corporate body. </para><para>Group registration. Two or more companies can be registered as a group for VAT purposes if one controls the others or some person controls all of them and each company either is resident in the UK for VAT purposes or has an established place of business in the UK. The representative group member is responsible for completing the VAT returns of the whole group and is principally liable for the whole group\u2019s VAT. One of the main advantages of group registration is that transactions between members of a group are ignored for VAT purposes. </para></speedread><fulltext><section1><para> <graphic fileref="binaryContent.jsp?item=835914"></graphic> </para><para>Value added tax (VAT), alone among UK taxes, is an EU tax. It is levied by HM Customs &amp; Excise on supplies for a consideration made by a "taxable person" in the UK in the course or furtherance of a business. </para><para>The broad framework of VAT is contained in a series of EC Directives, the principal one of which is the EC Sixth Directive (<emphasis role="italic">77/388/EEC</emphasis>). The primary UK legislation on VAT is the Value Added Tax Act 1994 (VATA 1994). This provides the framework of the tax but much of the detail is found in statutory instruments, either in the form of orders made by the Treasury or regulations made by Customs &amp; Excise. Where UK legislation is clearly in conflict with EC law, EC law prevails. </para><section2><title>Taxable person</title><para>A "taxable person" is an individual, limited company or other entity which is registered, or required to be registered, for VAT with Customs &amp; Excise. The threshold for compulsory registration is an historical annual turnover of \u00a350,000. A person must also register if he expects his turnover in the next 30 days to exceed \u00a350,000. However, a tax payer can choose to register if he has a taxable turnover below \u00a350,000. This is known as voluntary registration. </para></section2><section2><title>Input and output tax</title><para>The essence of VAT is that it should be borne economically by the ultimate consumer of the goods or services supplied. Traders may generally deduct an amount equal to the VAT on supplies to them ( <emphasis role="bold"> <emphasis role="italic">input tax</emphasis> </emphasis> ) from the VAT which they charge on supplies ( <emphasis role="bold"> <emphasis role="italic">output tax</emphasis> </emphasis> ), and only pay the difference to Customs &amp; Excise. Thus at each stage of the <emphasis role="bold"> <emphasis role="italic">supply chain</emphasis> </emphasis> the net VAT paid is on the value added at that stage. </para><para>Although the tax is borne ultimately by the consumer, it is the supplier that has to pay the VAT chargeable on the supply to Customs &amp; Excise as VAT is a liability of the person making the supply (<emphasis role="italic">section 1(2), VATA 1994</emphasis>). The supplier normally passes that liability on to his customer by identifying the price that he would have charged for his supply in the absence of VAT and increasing that price by an amount equal to the VAT that is in fact chargeable on the supply. A supplier''s liability to pay VAT is thus simply another expense that a supplier should take into account when charging for goods. The only difference from other expenses is that, by convention, the additional amount paid by the recipient of the supply in respect of VAT is separately delineated. </para><para>VAT is therefore not a charge on the consumer as such, nor is the consumer "paying VAT"; he is paying additional consideration for the supply equal to the VAT liability of the supplier. This is fundamental to understanding how VAT works. </para><para>VAT clauses in documents that refer to consideration being "exclusive of VAT" are therefore misconceived. What they should say is that the consideration is "exclusive of any amount arising in respect of VAT" on the supply in question and that the purchaser "will pay a sum equal to such amount to the vendor by way of additional consideration". </para></section2><section2><title>Calculation and rates</title><para>Supplies are divided into three main categories for VAT purposes:</para><itemizedlist> <listitem><para>Standard rated supplies.</para></listitem></itemizedlist><itemizedlist><listitem><para>test this</para></listitem> <listitem><para>Zero rated supplies.</para></listitem> <listitem><para>Exempt supplies.</para></listitem> </itemizedlist><para>A reduced rate of 5% applies to supplies of fuel and power for domestic and certain other qualifying uses. </para><para> <emphasis role="bold">Standard rated supplies.</emphasis> Most supplies are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 17.5%. In its simplest form (where each person in the supply chain apart from the ultimate consumer is fully taxable at the standard rate), the tax operates so as to cause each person in the supply chain (other than the end user) to account to Customs &amp; Excise for VAT on the value which that person adds to the goods or services in the chain, whilst the end user bears the cost of all the VAT previously accounted for. </para><para>The machinery devised to achieve this end is that each person in the supply chain pays to its suppliers input tax which is equal to the VAT on the gross value of the supplies it receives and accounts to Customs &amp; Excise for the output tax on the gross value of the supplies it makes. The input tax is wholly credited against the output tax, leaving the person with an overall liability to VAT which is equal to 17.5% of the value added by that person. </para><para>For example, suppose that A supplies parts to B and B uses those parts to make machinery which it then sells to C. Suppose that the parts are sold to B for \u00a3100 plus an amount in respect of VAT of \u00a317.50 and that B then sells the machinery to C for \u00a3200 plus an amount in respect of VAT of \u00a335. A will account to Customs &amp; Excise for output tax of \u00a317.50 in respect of its supply to B. B will account for output tax of \u00a335 in respect of its supply to C but will reclaim input tax of \u00a317.50 from Customs &amp; Excise. The net liability of B in respect of this transaction is therefore \u00a317.50. If C is not registered for VAT, it will have paid \u00a3235 to B for the machinery, which includes \u00a335 of irrecoverable input tax. This \u00a335 was accounted for to Customs &amp; Excise as to \u00a317.50 by B and \u00a317.50 by A (<emphasis role="italic">see inset box "A standard rated supply"</emphasis>). </para><para> <emphasis role="bold">Zero rated supplies.</emphasis> Zero rated supplies do not require the supplier to charge VAT. They comprise a number of socially beneficial items, such as new houses, children''s clothing, books, periodicals and newspapers ( <emphasis role="italic">Schedule 8, VATA 1994</emphasis>). </para><para>However, unlike an exempt supply, a zero rated supply is a taxable supply. It merely happens to be chargeable at a zero rate. A maker of zero rated supplies is able to recover all of the input tax which is attributable to his zero rated supplies (because such supplies are taxable) but is not required to account for output tax on those supplies (because of the zero rate). Thus, in economic terms, a zero rated supply breaks the accumulation of tax on added value which generally builds up in the supply chain. </para><para>For example, suppose that A supplies machinery to B, a clothes supplier, for \u00a3100 plus \u00a317.50 in respect of VAT. B uses the machinery to manufacture children''s clothes which it wishes to sell to C at a price which covers the cost of the machinery plus \u00a3100. The supply of children''s clothes is zero rated for VAT purposes. Accordingly, B will be able to recover the \u00a317.50 of input tax incurred on the acquisition of the machinery but will not be obliged to account for any output tax in respect of the supply of the children''s clothes to C. The effect of this is that, in setting its prices for C, B will take into account only \u00a3100 of machinery costs as B will have recovered an amount equal to the aggregate of the VAT accounted for by A. C will therefore only be charged \u00a3200 for the clothes ( <emphasis role="italic">see inset box "A zero rated supply"</emphasis>). </para><para> <emphasis role="bold">Exempt supplies.</emphasis> Where a person makes exempt supplies, he is treated in that respect as if he were the ultimate consumer . He is not required to account for output tax on his exempt supplies but he is unable to recover the input tax on those supplies which he has received that are attributable to his exempt supplies. In economic terms, this results in the ultimate consumer bearing the cost of value added by the standard rated suppliers earlier in the supply chain but not the cost of value added by the person making the exempt supply. Exempt supplies include financial services (for example, the sale of securities, lending money, underwriting, broking and insurance) and certain transactions in land and buildings (<emphasis role="italic">Schedule 9, VATA 1994</emphasis>). </para><para>For example, suppose that A supplies machinery to B, a bank, for \u00a3100 plus \u00a317.50 in respect of VAT. B uses the machinery for the purposes of financial services supplied to C for which he wishes to recover the cost of the machinery plus \u00a3100. As the supply of financial services is an exempt supply, B will not be obliged to account for output tax in respect of supplies made to C. As, however, the machinery is being used for the purposes of making exempt supplies, B is not able to recover the input tax of \u00a317.50 incurred on the acquisition of the machinery, and so the price charged by B to C will have to take into account this additional cost to B. C will therefore be charged \u00a3217.50 (<emphasis role="italic">see inset box "An exempt supply"</emphasis>). Failure by B to take into account this additional VAT cost will reduce B''s profits in the same way that failure to take into account any other business expense would do so. </para><para>If B is not making wholly exempt supplies, but rather is using the machinery to make both standard rated and exempt supplies, B will be able to recover a proportion of the input tax incurred on the acquisition of the machinery and so the cost taken into account by B as part of its overheads will be reduced. </para></section2><section2><title>Supply of goods and services</title><para>The VAT legislation does not exhaustively define the term "supply" but it is very broad in its scope. It is defined to include circumstances in which, for example, a taxable person takes goods out of a business for private use, borrows goods for private use or puts his services to private use. Therefore, where a solicitor who is a taxable person does his own house conveyancing and uses his office staff and facilities for this purpose, he must account for VAT on the cost. </para><para>The distinction as to whether a supply is one of goods or services is important as different rules apply to the time and place of supply. Also the treatment of the international supply of goods and services is different (<emphasis role="italic">see "Place of supply" and "Time of supply" below</emphasis>). </para><para>"Goods" include capital assets and stock in trade. A "service" for this purpose is not only the provision of advice or skills to someone but also any other thing that is not a supply of goods but is done for consideration (such as the making of a loan, the sale or issue of a share or the waiver of a legal right) (<emphasis role="italic">section 5(2), VATA 1994</emphasis>). A transaction in land may be either a supply of goods or services, depending on the nature of the interest in land that is the subject of the transaction. </para></section2><section2><title>Place of supply</title><para>To be within the charge to UK VAT, a supply must be made in the UK. Supplies made outside the UK are outside the scope of UK VAT (although they may be liable to VAT in another country). It is therefore important to establish where a particular supply is made. Separate rules apply to the supply of goods and services: </para><para> <emphasis role="bold">Goods.</emphasis> If goods are outside the UK, the supply is treated as made outside the UK. If goods are inside the UK, the supply is treated as made in the UK. </para><para>If the supply involves the removal of goods from the UK they are treated as supplied in the UK. If the supply involves the removal of goods to the UK they are to be treated as supplied outside the UK. </para><para>Therefore, exports are supplies of goods which are within the scope of VAT, whereas imports are supplies which are outside the scope of VAT, at least in relation to the charge to VAT on taxable supplies. The importer is however likely to be liable to account for VAT on the supply (<emphasis role="italic">see below</emphasis>). </para><para>Thus, the whole issue turns solely on the physical location of the goods themselves. It does not matter where either party to the supply has its main business presence. For example, if the goods that form the subject matter of the supply are held somewhere in the UK, the place of supply is in the UK even if neither the maker of the supply nor the recipient have any form of business establishment or other business presence in the UK. </para><para> <emphasis role="bold">Services.</emphasis> The basic rule is that a supply of services is treated as made in the country where the supplier himself "belongs" for VAT purposes (<emphasis role="italic">see inset box "Meaning of "belongs""</emphasis>). There are however a number of important exceptions to this basic rule ( <emphasis role="italic">VAT (Place of Supply of Services) Order 1992 SI 3121</emphasis>) (the Order). The main exceptions are: </para><itemizedlist> <listitem><para>Where a supply of services relates to land, it is treated as made in the country where the land in connection with which the supply is made is itself situated; it does not matter where either party to the supply "belongs". </para></listitem> <listitem><para>Where a supply of services consists of any services set out in Article 15 of the Order (which include, for example, conferences, sporting and entertainment services), it is treated as made in the country where the services themselves are physically carried out; it does not matter where either party to the supply belongs (<emphasis role="italic">see inset box "Article 15 services"</emphasis>). </para></listitem> <listitem><para>Where a person belonging in the UK makes a supply of any services falling within paragraphs (i)-(viii) of Schedule 5 of the VATA 1994 (which include legal, banking and financial services) to a person who belongs outside the UK and in a country (other than the Isle of Man) that is not an EU member state, the supply is treated as made in the country where the recipient "belongs" and is accordingly outside the scope of UK VAT (<emphasis role="italic">see inset box "Schedule 5 services"</emphasis>). </para></listitem> <listitem><para>Where a person belonging in the UK makes a supply of any Schedule 5 services to a person who "belongs" outside the UK but in a country that is another EU member state, the supply is treated as made in the member state where the recipient belongs, and is accordingly outside the scope of UK VAT if, and only if: </para><itemizedlist> <listitem><para>the recipient receives the supply for the purpose of a business carried on by him; and </para></listitem> <listitem><para>the recipient is registered for the local equivalent of VAT in the member state in which he belongs. </para></listitem> </itemizedlist><?Pub Caret1?></listitem> </itemizedlist></section2><section2><title>Time of supply</title><para>The time at which a supply of goods or services takes place is called the tax point.
