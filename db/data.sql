They comprise a number of socially\n            beneficial items such as new houses, however, unlike an exempt supply a zero rated supply is a taxable\n            supply chargeable at a zero rate. Suppliers are not required to account for output tax on exempt supplies\n            but are unable to recover the input tax on those supplies which they receive that are attributable to the\n            exempt supplies.

The\n                    input tax is wholly credited against the output tax, leaving the person with an overall liability to\n                    VAT which is equal to 17.5% of the value added by that person.\n                </para>\n                <para>For example, suppose that A supplies parts to B and B uses those parts to make machinery which it\n                    then sells to C.

It merely happens to be\n                    chargeable at a zero rate. A maker of zero rated supplies is able to recover all of the input tax\n                    which is attributable to his zero rated supplies (because such supplies are taxable) but is not\n                    required to account for output tax on those supplies (because of the zero rate). Thus, in economic\n                    terms, a zero rated supply breaks the accumulation of tax on added value which generally builds up\n                    in the supply chain.\n                </para>\n                <para>For example, suppose that A supplies machinery to B, a clothes supplier, for �100 plus �17.50 in\n                    respect of VAT. B uses the machinery to manufacture children''s clothes which it wishes to sell to C\n                    at a price which covers the cost of the machinery plus �100. The supply of children''s clothes is\n                    zero rated for VAT purposes. Accordingly, B will be able to recover the �17.50 of input tax incurred\n                    on the acquisition of the machinery but will not be obliged to account for any output tax in respect\n                    of the supply of the children''s clothes to C.

C will therefore only be charged �200 for the clothes (\n                    <emphasis role="italic">see inset box "A zero rated supply"</emphasis>).\n                </para>\n                <para>\n                    <emphasis role="bold">Exempt supplies.</emphasis>\n                    Where a person makes exempt supplies, he is treated in that respect as if he were the ultimate\n                    consumer . He is not required to account for output tax on his exempt supplies but he is unable to\n                    recover the input tax on those supplies which he has received that are attributable to his exempt\n                    supplies. In economic terms, this results in the ultimate consumer bearing the cost of value added\n                    by the standard rated suppliers earlier in the supply chain but not the cost of value added by the\n                    person making the exempt supply. Exempt supplies include financial services (for example, the sale\n                    of securities, lending money, underwriting, broking and insurance) and certain transactions in land\n                    and buildings (<emphasis role="italic">Schedule 9, VATA 1994</emphasis>).\n                </para>\n                <para>For example, suppose that A supplies machinery to B, a bank, for �100 plus �17.50 in respect of\n                    VAT.
